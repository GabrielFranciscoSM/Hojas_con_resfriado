\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Here, the problem to be solved is described (what do we want to do?), the motivation (why is it relevant to do it?), and the goals (what specific objectives are we going to address in order to solve the problem?).

We use the \LaTeX\  format of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_on_Computer_Vision_and_Pattern_Recognition}{CVPR} conference. This document can be written either in English or Spanish. 

What follows is a tentative approximation of the sections the document should have. If students consider that they need others, as well as subdividing the sections into different subsections, they can do it without problem.

Students can take inspiration from the \href{http://cs231n.stanford.edu/index.html}{cs231n} final projects website: \url{http://cs231n.stanford.edu/project.html}, where different projects are presented and developed. 

This whole final report can have from 6 to 8 pages (no more and no less).
